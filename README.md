Q.NO:-2 WHAT IS THE ORDER OF OPERATIONS USED FOR 
EVALUATING FORMULAS IN EXCEL?
ANS:-
When evaluating a formula, Excel follows a standard math protocol called "order of 
operations". In general, Excel's order of operation follows the acronym PEMDAS 
(Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction) but with some 
customization to handle the formula syntax in a spreadsheet.
When you combine several operations and functions into a single formula, Excel 
performs the operations in a predetermined order, known as the order of operations. 
When a formula contains several operators with the same precedence, Excel calculates the 
formula from left to right.
Calculation order
A formula in Excel always begins with an equal sign (=). Excel interprets the characters that 
follow the equal sign as a formula. Following the equal sign are the elements to be 
calculated (the operands), such as constants or cell references. These are separated by 
calculation operators.
